# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to visualize several key data points of a bike sharing company to determine the feasibility of expanding or creating the program in Des Moines, Iowa. 
The data visualized below is that of Citi Bikes trips taken in New York City in the year 2019. 

# Results 
The following visualizations can be found in whole at:  [link to dashboard]( https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBikesChallenge_16277880787610/CitiBikesChallenge?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link "link to dashboard")

1.	Initially we present a heat map detailing the overall number of trips taken by weekday and furthermore for every hour within each weekday. As can be observed, there is a general trend of higher ride counts during typical workday commuting hours.  Inversely during the weekends most trips are taken midday.

2.	We then looked at the average trip duration. From the chart presented we can determine that most trips taken are less than 1 hour in length. This seems to suggest most users that utilize the service live within close proximity of their end destination.

3.	We then looked at some gender statistics. The next three gender visualizations take a look at the following: 

-	Total amount of trips taken by gender segmented by day of the week and hour. 
-	The average trip duration by gender. 
-	The amount of rides taken by male and females subscribers and non-subscribers each day of the week. 

From the data we can see that the majority of our ridership are male subscribers and they tend to take most rides during the weekdays.

4.	Finally, we look at the most popular starting and ending locations. From the data it seems that vast majority of trips start in Manhattan and end in Manhattan.

# Summary 

Visualizing the New York City data is a strong step in pitching the expansion into Des Moines. We can see that most of the rider ship comes from male subscribers during typical “work commute” hours. The average ride is less than an hour in length, closer to 20 minutes in length, and is segmented to primarily one part of the city. From this we can surmise that a successful program in Des Moines will have several of the same characteristics. 

Two suggestions for further analysis are as follows: 
1.	A breakdown of trip cost per customer type, gender, and trip length. As the business is seeking a possible expansion data of this type is invaluable. 
2.	A breakdown of trip statistics by age. If the userbase is primarily segmented into a certain category, that insight could prove useful into determining if a Des Moines branch is feasible.
